The data itself was collected through questionable methods with little documentation, and was possibly even synthesized. Other factors, such as the unusual distribution of patient ages and the uniformity of the recovery rates across different diseases, which will be explored shortly, provide further support for the possibility.\n\n\nData Wrangling\nThis dataset requires separation of the training and test sets, and accounting for the missing values. The latter will be done after the EDA, to determine whether they should be imputed or omitted, and how, while the former must be done after the missing values are accounted for. For now, the categorical variables will be made into factors for ease of processing.\n\nlung_disease$Gender &lt;- as.factor(lung_disease$Gender)\nlung_disease$`Smoking Status`&lt;- as.factor(lung_disease$`Smoking Status`)\nlung_disease$Recovered &lt;- as.factor(lung_disease$Recovered) \nlung_disease$`Disease Type`&lt;- as.factor(lung_disease$`Disease Type`)\nlung_disease$`Treatment Type` &lt;- as.factor(lung_disease$`Treatment Type`)"

    "text": "Exploratory Data Analysis\nWe will first look at the missing parts of the data, to determine if there are any visible patterns or correlations in the missing data points that will be informative. A simple plot shows that the data seems to be missing at random, with little correlation between variables. Utilizing a test for randomness reveals the same. Such a uniform distribution of missing values is highly inconsistent with real-life data collection, and another point in favor of this data being synthetic, or at least highly flawed in its collection. However, the fact that the data is missing completely at random means that data can be imputed without fear of greatly affecting the resulting model.\n\nmcar_test(lung_disease)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n  statistic    df p.value missing.patterns\n      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;int&gt;\n1      370.   391   0.770               71\n\n\n\nvis_miss(lung_disease)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a few other inconsistencies in this dataset, which can be seen when examining the data more closely. A look at the recovery rates for each disease shows the following:\n\nlung_disease %&gt;%\n  select(Recovered,`Disease Type`) %&gt;% \n    na.omit() %&gt;% \n    count(Recovered, `Disease Type`) %&gt;%   \n    group_by(`Disease Type`) %&gt;%\n    mutate(percent_recovered = prop.table(n) * 100) %&gt;%\n  filter(Recovered == \"Yes\")\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 4\n# Groups:   Disease Type [5]\n  Recovered `Disease Type`     n percent_recovered\n  &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;          &lt;int&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Yes       Asthma           485              51.6\n2 Yes       Bronchitis       456              47.7\n3 Yes       COPD             509              53.8\n4 Yes       Lung Cancer      461              52.5\n5 Yes       Pneumonia        432              48.2\n\n\nWe can see that the proportion of patients who successfully recovered is approximately 50% for each disease. This is, of course, inconsistent with the real-life rates of recovery for these diseases.\nDespite the data being inconsistent with reality, it is the data we have, so we will model with it, as a demonstration of the modeling techniques. Before we do so, we will look for any correlation between the variables.\n\npairs(lung_disease)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatter plots here do not show any obvious relationships between two variables, with any patterns simply being from the limited number of values for the categorical variables. We would expect some level of correlation between some variables, such as smoking being associated with lung cancer and COPD. the fcat that this is not the case is yet another limitation for our data.\n\nData Wrangling (Continued)\nWith the EDA complete, the imputation as well as the creation of the training and test sets can be done.\n\n# | echo: false\nset.seed(1337)\nlung_impute &lt;- mice(lung_disease, m = 1)\n\n\n iter imp variable\n  1   1  Age  Gender  Smoking Status  Lung Capacity  Disease Type  Treatment Type  Hospital Visits  Recovered\n  2   1  Age  Gender  Smoking Status  Lung Capacity  Disease Type  Treatment Type  Hospital Visits  Recovered\n  3   1  Age  Gender  Smoking Status  Lung Capacity  Disease Type  Treatment Type  Hospital Visits  Recovered\n  4   1  Age  Gender  Smoking Status  Lung Capacity  Disease Type  Treatment Type  Hospital Visits  Recovered\n  5   1  Age  Gender  Smoking Status  Lung Capacity  Disease Type  Treatment Type  Hospital Visits  Recovered\n\nlung_final &lt;- complete(lung_impute,1)\nlung_split&lt;- initial_split(lung_final,prop = 0.8)\nlung_train &lt;- training(lung_split)\nlung_test &lt;- testing(lung_split)"

The dataset itself was poorly documented in its collection, if it was even collected as all. The performance of this model is evidence that any model can only be as effective as the data used to train it, and this data was completely ineffective."
