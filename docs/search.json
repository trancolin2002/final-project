The data itself was collected through questionable methods with little documentation, and was possibly even synthesized. Other factors, such as the unusual distribution of patient ages and the uniformity of the recovery rates across different diseases, which will be explored shortly, provide further support for the possibility.\n\n\nData Wrangling (Optional Section)\nThe only data wrangling that this dataset requires is separation of the training and test sets, and accounting the missing values. The latter will be done after the EDA, to determine whether they should be imputed or omitted, and how, while the former must be done after the missing values are accounted for."

    "text": "Exploratory Data Analysis\nWe will first look at the missing parts of the data, to determine if there are any visible patterns or correlations in the missing data points that will be informative. A simple plot shows that the data seems to be missing at random, with little correlation between variables. Such a uniform distribution of missing values is not consistent with real-life data collection.\n\nvis_miss(lung_disease)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a few other inconsistencies in this dataset, which can be seen when examining the data more closely. A look at the recovery rates for each disease shows the following:\n\nlung_disease %&gt;%\n  select(Recovered,`Disease Type`) %&gt;% \n    na.omit() %&gt;% \n    count(Recovered, `Disease Type`) %&gt;%   \n    group_by(`Disease Type`) %&gt;%\n    mutate(percent_recovered = prop.table(n) * 100) %&gt;%\n  filter(Recovered == \"Yes\")\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 4\n# Groups:   Disease Type [5]\n  Recovered `Disease Type`     n percent_recovered\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;int&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Yes       Asthma           485              51.6\n2 Yes       Bronchitis       456              47.7\n3 Yes       COPD             509              53.8\n4 Yes       Lung Cancer      461              52.5\n5 Yes       Pneumonia        432              48.2\n\n\nWe can see that the proportion of patients who successfully recovered is approximately 50% for each disease. This is, of course, inconsistent with the real-life rates of recovery for these diseases."
